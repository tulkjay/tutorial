Chapter 6 Subqueries
WHERE
HAVING
FROM
SELECT

Usually in FROM and WHERE.

Can return scalar(single value), single column, or  table.

Order by inside of subquery is used to position data into the correct location.
Do actual ordering on outer query.
Usually subquery can be turned into inner joins.
Outer query cannot select from tables used in subquery.
Very useful with IN clause.

IN can be substituted with LEFT JOIN(LEFT JOIN is more efficient for NOT IN)
