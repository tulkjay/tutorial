Chapter 10 Designing a DB
Table represents an entity
Row is instance of entity
Column is attribute
You can use CASE - computer aided software engineering.
Composite key - two of more columns.
Keys maintain referential integrity.

You can use cascade delete to remove referenced instances.
In addition to cascade delete, you can set to NULL or some other default.
Cascade rule is set on each individual relation.

Normalization
Saves on space, but increases complexity.
Data warehouses or Staging databases might flatten tables to make faster querying.

Index when column is a foreign key.
"" used frequently.
"" lots of distinct values.
"" updated infrequently.

Clustered index is tracking index(usually primary key).
Not good to reassign because reordering has to occur.

Composite index includes two or more columns.

Normal forms
1 - Scalar values for each column(ie: full name => first, last)
2 - non-key column is dependent on primary key.
3 - non-key column is dependent only on primary key.
5 - Break down relations to minimize data redundancy.
    -Increases complexity.

Chapter 11 - Creating a DB
CREATE, ALTER, DROP

function, procedure, triggers, views

#name = temporary table.
@@ global variable
## global temporary table.
Gets purged when connection drops.

Other identifiers can be delimited. Best Practice is to not.
Up to 128 characters.

CREATE DATABASE name

Will use server defaults for names, unless otherwise specified.

CREATE TABLE name (column name data-type [column attributes]...)
[, table_attributes]

Up to 1024 columns
SPARSE - Used to optimize NULL values.
    Used if many instances will have NULL values(ie international phone number). Usually if >60% have NULL.

Creating indices.
CREATE INDEX name ON tableName (columnName1, columnName2)
WHERE condition

Table seek is using index as opposed to Table scan.

Using ctrl+k, ctrl+x to insert snippets

Constraints
Column level and table level
Useful for defining composite Keys

CHECK constraint limits values for a column.
foreign keys are constraints.
REFERENCES tableName columnName

Constraints can be updated(with or without integrity checks)

Can't be false or unknown for a check constraint result.
To return custom error response, wrap execution(probably a stored procedure)
    with try catch and return desired response.
Easier to handle rules on application side.

Foreign keys   
Column level
REFERENCES tableName (columnName)
    [ON DELETE {CASCADE|NO_ACTION}] --NO_ACTION is default
    [ON UPDATE {CASCADE|NO_ACTION}] --NO_ACTION is default

Table level
FOREIGN KEY (columnName1, ...)
REFERENCES tableName (columnName, ...)
    [ON DELETE {CASCADE|NO_ACTION}] --NO_ACTION is default
    [ON UPDATE {CASCADE|NO_ACTION}] --NO_ACTION is default

DROP
Will delete foreign keys and constraints as well.

ALTER TABLE name [WITH_CHECK|WITH NOCHECK]
    ADD, DROP, ALTER, ...

Sequence
CREATE SEQUENCE
Useful for setting default value on table if no primary key.
use NEXT VALUE FOR sequenceName

You can restart a sequence with an ALTER SEQUENCE statement.

When creating a table, foreign key tables must be defined first.

Chapter 12 Using SSMS
Log file has heavy i/o.
SAN - storage area network.
SAN gets set up with slow and fast storage areas.
Containment type in options - security feature.
    partial - Treats user in database as single login object.
Collation is for database language. Can change to case sensitive here.

You can generate a change script when modifying an object to see what will happen when save is clicked.

Use icon buttons to manage foreign keys, indices, etc.

Use WITH SCHEMABINDING on views to show error when trying to change its referenced schema.
Use Script to to show script to execute action in new window.
