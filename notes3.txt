Chapter 10 Designing a DB
Table represents an entity
Row is instance of entity
Column is attribute
You can use CASE - computer aided software engineering.
Composite key - two of more columns.
Keys maintain referential integrity.

You can use cascade delete to remove referenced instances.
In addition to cascade delete, you can set to NULL or some other default.
Cascade rule is set on each individual relation.

Normalization
Saves on space, but increases complexity.
Data warehouses or Staging databases might flatten tables to make faster querying.

Index when column is a foreign key.
"" used frequently.
"" lots of distinct values.
"" updated infrequently.

Clustered index is tracking index(usually primary key).
Not good to reassign because reordering has to occur.

Composite index includes two or more columns.

Normal forms
1 - Scalar values for each column(ie: full name => first, last)
2 - non-key column is dependent on primary key.
3 - non-key column is dependent only on primary key.
5 - Break down relations to minimize data redundancy.
    -Increases complexity.
