Chapter 10 Designing a DB
Table represents an entity
Row is instance of entity
Column is attribute
You can use CASE - computer aided software engineering.
Composite key - two of more columns.
Keys maintain referential integrity.

You can use cascade delete to remove referenced instances.
In addition to cascade delete, you can set to NULL or some other default.
Cascade rule is set on each individual relation.

Normalization
Saves on space, but increases complexity.
Data warehouses or Staging databases might flatten tables to make faster querying.

Index when column is a foreign key.
"" used frequently.
"" lots of distinct values.
"" updated infrequently.

Clustered index is tracking index(usually primary key).
Not good to reassign because reordering has to occur.

Composite index includes two or more columns.

Normal forms
1 - Scalar values for each column(ie: full name => first, last)
2 - non-key column is dependent on primary key.
3 - non-key column is dependent only on primary key.
5 - Break down relations to minimize data redundancy.
    -Increases complexity.

Chapter 11 - Creating a DB
CREATE, ALTER, DROP

function, procedure, triggers, views

#name = temporary table.
@@ global variable
## global temporary table.
Gets purged when connection drops.

Other identifiers can be delimited. Best Practice is to not.
Up to 128 characters.

CREATE DATABASE name

Will use server defaults for names, unless otherwise specified.

CREATE TABLE name (column name data-type [column attributes]...)
[, table_attributes]

Up to 1024 columns
SPARSE - Used to optimize NULL values.
    Used if many instances will have NULL values(ie international phone number). Usually if >60% have NULL.
