Chapter 13 - Views
Select results stored as object, considered a virtual table.
Reusable
Cuts down building execution plan
Con: Can be wasteful if view is too broad for use case.
Views can be used to remove sensitive columns/rows from tables
Can hide the complexity of some queries

CREATE VIEW name
[WITH {ENCRYPTION|SCHEMABINDING}]   
AS select_statement
[WITH CHECK OPTION]

Check options will secure rows(ie can't insert/update row to data outside of check option)
Schemabinding will check for changes to referred tables.
ENCRYPTION will prevent editing after creation

Updatable views:
No distinct/top, no aggregates, no calculated values, no grouping or having, no union.
Only one table can be updated
Useful for restricted access

If view is not updatable, it is a read-only view

Modifying a view
DROP VIEW view_name
ALTER VIEW same as view creation syntax.

Inserts can only be done on a single table.

*** Functions do not use Indices!
Use line comparisons that do not modify columns instead.
When inspecting execution plan, prefer index seek instead of index scan

Chapter 14 Scripts
Usually used for running multiple scripts together.
Use GO to separate batches
USE - changes database context
DECLARE variable_name type
PRINT value
SET variable_name = expression or value,
EXEC

Flow controls
IF, ELSE
BEGIN, END
WHILE
BREAK
CONTINUE
TRY, CATCH
GOTO
RETURN - Exits unconditionally

Variables: prefix with @, can use comma separated values

@@variable_name makes a global variable

Table Variables
DECLARE @table_name TABLE (column_name1 type [attributes], etc, table_attributes)
Can be treated like a normal table

Temporary table
Select ...
INTO #table_name
FROM ...

Then the temporary table may be used like a normal table.
Temporary tables may also be created using the CREATE TABLE syntax.

Table variable is stored in memory,
temporary tables stored on disk

Best to limit table variables to ~10000 rows, depending on data type.

Flow controls
IF bool_exp
    {statement|BEGIN...END}
[ELSE
    {statement|BEGIN...END}]

can be nested

IF EXISTS object_name
IE: DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS TestDb.
Different ways:
IF DB_ID('TestDb') IS NOT NULL
    DROP DATABASE TestDb
OR for tables, use object_id

WHILE expression
    {statement|BEGIN...END}
    [BREAK]
    [CONTINUE]

Cursors
Usually slower than using set operations
Declare a cursor name for select statement.
open cursor
Cursor can be made read-only or modifiable(cursor will place locks on items if not read-only).

You loop through cursor fetch values to work row by row.
when done, you close and deallocate cursor.

FETCH NEXT FROM cursor_name INTO @temp_variables
WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS <> -1
    BEGIN
        DOING STUFF
        FETCH NEXT FROM cursor name into @temp variables
    END;

Usually don't use cursors unless needed.

BEGIN TRY
    {sql_statement|statement_block}
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    {sql_statement|statement_block}
END CATCH

You can access ERROR_[number, message, severity, state] functions inside catch catch block.
Severities 10 and under or 20 and over are not handled

@@IDENTITY returns last id generated
IDENT_CURRENT('table_name') returns last id generated for specified table.

Usually SCOPE_IDENTITY() that returns latest generated in current scope.
You can use HOST_NAME() or SYSTEM_USER to get current workstation and current user.

Session settings can be changed
SET setting_name value
date format, 
ansi_nulls(to use column = null syntax), 
ansi_padding, 
ROWCOUNT(to set top(n) for session)
Useful is SET NOCOUNT {ON|OFF}

EXEC aka EXECUTE - Used to create dynamic sql
Runs a sql string
IE: Make a table where column names are results of query :O

Dynamic sql string and user input can create sql injection.

Chapter 15 - Stored Procedures, Functions, Triggers
SPs, Functions, and triggers only have one batch.
SPs and functions take parameters.

CREATE PROCEDURE spName --Or PROC
AS

Does not have to return a result set.
Includes input and output parameters.
Fired off with EXEC spName.
Execution plan might be modified as the sproc gets used.
Like views, sprocs can be created with ENCRYPTION, so that the sproc cannot be modified.
EXECUTE_AS_clause will recompile each time.
Parameter list follows name

IE: 
CREATE PROC spTest
    @DateVar smalldatetime = NULL,
    @InvTotal money OUTPUT
AS 
SELECT @InvTotal = SUM(...)
FROM ...
WHERE ... > @DateVar

= NULL is a default parameter option, runtime error will occur is no default is given.
Or put If @asdf Is null
    select @asdf = default option.
...
Ordinarily, optional parameters are listed last, so that naming the input variables is not required.
