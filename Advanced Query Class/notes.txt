Views
Select results stored as object, considered a virtual table.
Reusable
Cuts down building execution plan
Con: Can be wasteful if view is too broad for use case.
Views can be used to remove sensitive columns/rows from tables
Can hide the complexity of some queries

CREATE VIEW name
[WITH {ENCRYPTION|SCHEMABINDING}]   
AS select_statement
[WITH CHECK OPTION]

Check options will secure rows(ie can't insert/update row to data outside of check option)
Schemabinding will check for changes to referred tables.
ENCRYPTION will prevent editing after creation

Updatable views:
No distinct/top, no aggregates, no calculated values, no grouping or having, no union.
Only one table can be updated
Useful for restricted access

If view is not updatable, it is a read-only view

Modifying a view
DROP VIEW view_name
ALTER VIEW same as view creation syntax.

Inserts can only be done on a single table.
